                <b>Pure Data is a free and open source visual programming language for creating computer music.</b>
            </p>
            <p>
              Created by mathematician Miller Puckette in 1996, Pure Data allows you to build audio synthesis, analysis and processing applications using an interface of interconnecting objects. It is widely used by musicians, sound designers, and researchers for everything from live performance to instillation art.
            </p>
	<p>Pure Data is a real-time audio processing and is completely free and open-source. Unlike other computer music software alternatives, Pure Data gives you direct access to the building blocks of digital signal processing. You can create custom synthesizers, samplers, effects processors, tuning systems, and interactive sound installations using Pure Data's visual construction kit-like set up.</p>

	<p>The software runs on Windows, macOS, Linux, and embedded systems like Raspberry Pi, making it versatile for different projects.</p>
            <p>
		With this website I wanted to create a place to showcase my own patches I've created to produce my organ music digitally, and patches I've created to utilize alternative tuning systems.
            </p>
	<p>Using the links in the sidebar, you can navigate to different pages to look at resources for using Pure Data, an about page for information about me, and a gallery for patches I've created in Pure Data </p>
